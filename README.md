# Drowsiness_Detection

In todays world 21% of accidents are happening due to drowsy driving. sleep related crashes are most common in young people between the ages of 18 and 29.
There can be many causes like lack of sleep, tiredness, driving long distance alone may lead to feel drowsiness while driving car. 
In this project we will build a Neural network model which will be able to predict if person is drowsy or not.
Drowsiness detection can be used in cars to detect if driver is feeling drowsy while driving car, this will alert the driver and will help to avoid many car accidents.
